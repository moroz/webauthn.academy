title: Implementing Webauthn in Elixir

This section is dedicated to implementing a Webauthn registration and authentication workflow using the Phoenix framework for the Elixir programming language.
Since this is the programming language and Web framework I have worked the most over the course of my career, and since I have recently worked on such an implementation, this section may well be the most complete part of the website.
